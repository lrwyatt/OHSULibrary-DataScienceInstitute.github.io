### OHSU Data Science Institute (ODSI) Code of Conduct

All attendees, instructors, sponsors and volunteers at our institute are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the institute. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### Need Help?

Please contact [add email] or notify one of the event organizers with any questions or issues.

### The Quick Version

The ODSI is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of institute participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any learning environment, including sessions, happy hour, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the institute at the discretion of the organizers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the institute.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the ODSI organizers immediately.

The organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the institute. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at institute venue and institute-related social events.
